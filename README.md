The project was created to build and simulate a MySQL DB with basic necessary features. It has its own authentication and authorization mechanism along with encryption and storage of user passwords. It contains basic options like user registration and login, it's own SQL command prompt, custom MySQL dump, and ERD export option. It implements queries like CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, SQL DUMP, ERD Generation and FOREIGN KEY SUPPORT.

Additionally, it supports concurrent transactions using time based table locking mechanism. It can handle concurrent users at a time and accepts the queries in SQL format. It follows ACID properties like any other database and generates both generic and event based logs as per the transactions.
